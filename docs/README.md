## Project Structure
```
scholars-website/
├── client/             # Next.js frontend
├── server/             # Express backend
├── shared/             # Shared types and utilities
└── docs/              # Project documentation
```

## Technology Stack
1. Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)
   * React components with TypeScript
   * Tailwind CSS for styling
   * Recharts for data visualization
   * File structure:
     ```
     client/
     ├── src/
     │   ├── app/              # Next.js App Router
     │   │   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout
     │   │   └── page.tsx      # Home page
     │   └── styles/           # Global styles
     ```

2. Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
   * RESTful API endpoints with TypeScript
   * Basic endpoints structure:
     ```
     server/
     ├── src/
     │   ├── index.ts          # Entry point
     │   ├── routes/           # API routes
     │   └── controllers/      # Route handlers
     ```

### Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

3. Database (To be implemented)
   * Options we could consider:
     * MongoDB - Good for flexible scholar data
     * PostgreSQL - Better for structured academic relationships
     * SQLite - Simple option for early development

4. Additional Features to Consider
   * Authentication (e.g., JWT tokens)
   * Data validation (e.g., Zod/Yup)
   * Caching layer
   * Rate limiting

## Getting Started
1. Review the [installation guide](setup/installation.md)
2. Set up your development environment
3. Follow the [coding standards](development/coding-standards.md)
4. Check the [git workflow](development/git-workflow.md)
